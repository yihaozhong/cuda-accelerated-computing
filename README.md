# cuda-accelerated-computing

## Introduction
- This is my learning path as a developer to accelerated computing using CUDA, and the language used is Python and C++.

- This is also the first component of **Beginner to Expert: AI Technical Training**, a NVIDIA Developer Program

## Selected Structure (folder name)
- An Even Easier Introduction to CUDA (intro)
- Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++ (accelerated)
- Accelerating CUDA C++ Applications with Concurrent Streams (concurrent)
- Scaling Workloads Across Multiple GPUs with CUDA C++ (scaling)
- Optimizing CUDA ML Codes with NVIDIA Nsight's Profiling Tools (profiling)
